# Retrospective ⏪

“_Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and
abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand._” __NORM KERTH.__

___Over the past weeks, our group embarked on the journey of learning and
practicing effective code reviews. This retrospective aims to reflect on our
experiences, evaluate what went well, identify areas for improvement, and
outline actionable steps to enhance our skills further. By reviewing our
process and establishing the best practices for future code reviews, we hope
to foster a collaborative environment.___

## Stop doing 🙅‍♂️

   1. Stop merging changes without proper reviews.

## Continue doing 👍

   1. Regular code reviews.
   2. Helping each other out to ensure no one is left behind.
   3. Carrying out regular video calls
   4. Being active in the group
   5. Automated testing for critical features
   6. Setting clear deadlines for deliverables
   7. Sharing resources and insights to improve team knowledge and skills collectively.

## Start doing 🚀

   1. __Conducting regular check-ins to align on progress and adjust priorities
    as needed.__
   2. __Tracking and addressing recurring issues__; _We noticed that some issues,
   like not using descriptive enough names for variables (e.g., naming a
   variable s instead of binary_str), kept coming up during our reviews. To
   avoid making the same mistakes as a group and having to point them out
   individually each time, we plan to keep a shared list of these common
   issues. This way, everyone can see and remember them, helping us improve
   and use better practices in future projects._

## Lessons Learned 🎓

   1. __Importance of clear communication and task assignment__
   2. __Benefits of automated testing and continuous integration__
   3. __Value of regular team feedback and retrospectives__
   4. __The importance of role clarity__: _Assigning clear roles in each review
   cycle (e.g., reviewer, author, maintainer) ensures accountability and
   smoothens the workflow_.
   5. __The value of iterative learning__: _Every mistake or challenge faced during
   this process offered an opportunity to grow and refine our practices._
   6. __Effective prioritization leads to efficiency__: _Focus on the most
   impactful changes during reviews to optimize time and effort._

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected? 👍

1. __Improved understanding of code-reviewing principles__; _Throughout this pro
   ject, we gained a deeper understanding of the importance of code-reviewing an
   d how to apply best practices._
2. __Effective collaboration__; _Group members worked well together, providing c
   onstructive feedback and supporting each other in the learning process which
    allowed us to refine our approach and improve both our coding practices and c
   ommunication. This made the code review process not only more effective but a
   lso more rewarding, as we could see visible improvements over time._
3. __Keeping deadlines on track and the delivery of work as expected.__

### What parts of your plan did not work out? 👎

   1. __Initial struggle with code review tools__; _We faced some challenges get
   ting familiar with the code review tools, but eventually got the hang of it._
   2. __We weren't quite able to fully help each other out as a colleague of our
   s decided not to continue with the program.__

### Did you need to add things that weren’t in your strategy? 🤔

   1. __Dedicated Learning Time for Tools__; _Some team members needed more time
    to learn and practice using tools like GitHub and setting up the environment
    . While we helped each other whenever needed during our meetings, it would h
    ave saved time if we had set aside time specifically for learning the tools.
     This could have been done either together in a session at the beginning or
      by giving everyone extra time upfront to get familiar with the tools. Exte
      nding the deadlines a bit would also have helped everyone feel more comforta
     ble and avoided early delays._
