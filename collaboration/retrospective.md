# Retrospective :rewind:

“_Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand._” __NORM KERTH.__

__*Over the past weeks, our group embarked on the journey of learning and practicing effective code reviews. This retrospective aims to reflect on our experiences, evaluate what went well, identify areas for improvement, and outline actionable steps to enhance our skills further. By reviewing our process and establishing the best practices for future code reviews, we hope to foster a collaborative environment.*__

## Stop doing :no_good:

   1. Stop merging changes without proper reviews.

## Continue doing :thumbsup:

   1. Regular code reviews.
   2. Helping each other out to ensure no one is left behind.
   3. Carrying out regular video calls
   4. Being active in the group
   5. Automated testing for critical features
   6. Setting clear deadlines for deliverables
   7. Sharing resources and insights to improve team knowledge and skills collectively.

## Start doing :rocket:

   1. __Conducting regular check-ins to align on progress and adjust priorities as needed.__
   2. __Tracking and addressing recurring issues__; _We noticed that some issues, like not using descriptive enough names for variables (e.g., naming a variable s instead of binary_str), kept coming up during our reviews. To avoid making the same mistakes as a group and having to point them out individually each time, we plan to keep a shared list of these common issues. This way, everyone can see and remember them, helping us improve and use better practices in future projects._

## Lessons Learned :mortar_board:

1. __Importance of clear communication and task assignment__
2. __Benefits of automated testing and continuous integration__
3. __Value of regular team feedback and retrospectives__
4. __The importance of role clarity__: _Assigning clear roles in each review cycle (e.g., reviewer, author, maintainer) ensures accountability and smoothens the workflow_.
5. __The value of iterative learning__: _Every mistake or challenge faced during this process offered an opportunity to grow and refine our practices._
6. __Effective prioritization leads to efficiency__: _Focus on the most impactful changes during reviews to optimize time and effort._
