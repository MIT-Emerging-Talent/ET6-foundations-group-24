# Constraints README 📝

## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to the Constraints README! This document is here to help us understand
the challenges and limitations each team member faces while working on this project.
Since we're all learning and working remotely, there can be obstacles like different
time zones 🌍, schedules ⏰, weak internet 🌐, power outages ⚡, or simply being
new to GitHub 💻.

By outlining these constraints, we aim to make collaboration easier and ensure
everyone feels supported as we learn and grow together. Don’t worry, this is a
beginner-friendly space, and we’re all here to help each other improve!

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this document is to identify and acknowledge the constraints we each
face while working on this project. By being transparent about our challenges,
we can plan better, support each other, and ensure smooth progress as a team.

## Constraints ⚖️

### External Constraints 🌐

These are factors that come from the outside and are beyond the team's control:

- **Project Deadlines:** ⏳ Deadlines set externally that affect how quickly we
need to deliver.
- **Number of Unit Tests:** 🧪 The number of unit tests required to pass a code review.
- **Schedules:** Academic, work, or personal commitments that limit availability.
- **Power or Connectivity Issues:** ⚡ Unpredictable external problems like power
outages or poor internet that could disrupt work.

### Internal: Involuntary Constraints 🚶‍♀️

These are factors that come from within the team, and we have no control over them:

- **Individual Skill Levels:** 🧑‍💻 Varying levels of expertise among team members.
- **Task Preferences:** Specific tasks you enjoy or want to focus on to improve
your skills.
- **Time Availability:** ⏰ The amount of time available to work on the project
may vary from person to person.
- **Communication Delays:** 💬: Just a heads-up,
replies might take a little longer since we're all working at different times
or with flexible schedules.

---

### Internal: Voluntary Constraints 🙋‍♂️

These are constraints that the team decides on to help scope and organize the
project. These can be voluntarily agreed upon to make the project manageable:

- **Coding Style & Conventions:** 🎨 Deciding on a standard coding style (e.g.,
indentations, naming conventions).
- **Code Review Checklist:** ✅ Creating a checklist for code reviews to
ensure consistency
and all code must be reviewed before merging into the main branch with
constructive feedback
- **Hours to Spend Working:** 🕒 Deciding on a specific amount of time the team
wants to spend working per week.
- **GitHub & Version Control Constraints:** 🔄
- All work must be committed to GitHub regularly.
Each task or feature should be worked on in its own separate branch.
- **Branch names:** 🌿 must be descriptive and clear and related to the problem
- **time-sensitive tasks :** ⏱️ Should be addressed promptly
(e.g., bug fixes or urgent feature additions)
- **Resource Constraints:** 📚 All team members need to have access to the necessary
tools and resources (VS Code, GitHub, Necessary extensions)
- **Communication Tools:** 🛠️ Slack for daily updates,
Google meet for weekly meetings

---

## Tips for Managing Challenges 💡

Here are some simple tips to help us overcome common constraints:

- **Time Zones:** 🕑 Use a shared tool like Google Calendar to plan meetings at
times that work for everyone.
- **Weak Internet:** 🌐 Keep changes small and commit frequently to avoid large uploads.
- **GitHub Beginners:** 🚀 Start with the GitHub Desktop app for an easier
introduction to Git.

## Individual Constraints 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

Please add your own constraints below, using the template provided. This will
help everyone understand your challenges and plan accordingly.

### Template

- **Skill Level:** 📊 [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced in tools like GitHub or
VS Code]
- **Challenges:** 🌐 [Internet issues, limited resources, etc.]

### Example Entry (Just an example, could be anything) 🤔

- **Skill Level:** Beginner with GitHub, might need help resolving conflicts 🆘
- **Challenges:** Weak internet at night, may miss late-night pushes 🌙

## Final Note 📝

Please don’t hesitate to share your constraints or ask for help if you’re stuck.
This is a learning experience for all of us, and we’re here to support each other!
**The more open we are, the better we can work together.** 🤝
