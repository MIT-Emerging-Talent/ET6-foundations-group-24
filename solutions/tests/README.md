## **Purpose: The Quest for Perfection** 🎯

The tests are designed to:

1. **Verify the correctness** of solutions.
2. **Ensure edge cases and special conditions** are handled properly.
3. **Maintain the reliability and robustness** of the codebase.

---

## **Directory Structure: Organized for Success** 📂

- Each solution will have a corresponding **test file or folder**.
- Tests are **categorized** based on the problem/task they validate. 📑

---

## **Writing Tests: The Art of Validation** 🎨

- Use **consistent naming conventions** for test files.
- Follow the team's testing framework or tools (e.g., **PyTest**).
- **Cover all edge cases, normal cases, and error cases**. 🌐
