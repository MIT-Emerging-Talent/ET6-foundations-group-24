# Tests

This is the **Tests** directory of Group 24, dedicated to validating the solutions and ensuring the functionality and correctness of the implementations.

## Purpose

The tests are designed to:

1. Verify the correctness of solutions.
2. Ensure edge cases and special conditions are handled properly.
3. Maintain the reliability and robustness of the codebase.

## Directory Structure

- Each solution will have a corresponding test file or folder.
- Tests are categorized based on the problem/task they validate.

## Writing Tests

- Use consistent naming conventions for test files (e.g., `test_<solution_name>.py`).
- Follow the team's testing framework or tools (e.g., **PyTest**).
- Cover all edge cases, normal cases, and error cases.

## Running Tests

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
2. Use the designated command for the testing framework (e.g., `pytest`, `npm test`, etc.).
3. Ensure all tests pass before pushing changes.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Write clear and concise test cases.
2. Ensure test cases are independent of each other.
3. Document the purpose of each test case in comments.

## Contact

If you encounter any issues with the tests or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to contact the team members or test maintainers.
