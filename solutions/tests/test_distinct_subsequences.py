"""
Test module for the count_distinct_subsequences function.
Contains comprehensive tests to ensure the correctness
of the count_distinct_subsequences function.

Test categories:
    - Standard cases: Common strings with matching subsequences,
    non-matching strings.
    - Edge cases: Empty t string, empty s string,
    both strings empty, repeated characters.
    - Performance tests: Large strings to verify efficiency with memoization.
    - Defensive tests: Non-string inputs, invalid types for s and t.
